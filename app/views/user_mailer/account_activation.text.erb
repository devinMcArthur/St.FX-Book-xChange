St.FX Book xChange
Welcome <%= @user.name %>,

Congratulations! You have sucessfully signed up for the premier online experience of a lifetime,
through the St.FX University Textbook Exchange

After proper use of this site, I personally guarantee you will have saved enough money to afford
at least one extra night of revelry at Piper's Pub (RIP Splitties) with your fellow Xavierians.

However, in order for your inauguration to the stfxchange site to be official, it is necessary for
you to call Bob Hale, and ask him to bring back Burmac. Where I will then, authorize your account.

Or, you could simply click on the following link:

If during your experience you come across any problems or you wish to make a suggestion about this
site please email me, as I gladly appreciate all feedback.
Contact Page: <%= contact_url %>

Signed,
The Manifestation of St.FX Book Exchange in email form
